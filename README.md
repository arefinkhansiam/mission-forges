# Mission Forge

An interactive, scientifically transparent, browser-based space mission design and simulation game: build a spacecraft, plan orbital trajectories, launch in 3D, and simulate real astronautical physics.

## Judge Quick Start

**Live URL:** [https://mission-forges.vercel.app](https://mission-forges.vercel.app) *(Best experienced on desktop or landscape on tablets/mobile)*

### 60-Second Demo Path
1. **Home:** Review live APOD and space telemetry, click **Start Mission**, choose **Mars** (or Europa / Titan / Moon).
2. **Objective & Route:** Select mission profile (Surface Sample Return, Orbital Survey, or Deep Probe) and choose trajectory (Hohmann Transfer vs Fast Insertion).
3. **Subsystems:** Allocate budget, fuel (Hydrolox / Methalox / Xenon), power (Solar Arrays vs RTG), high-gain comms dish, and scientific instrument payloads.
4. **Hangar (3D):** Toggle between modular procedural spacecraft and official NASA 3D flight hardware (Curiosity, Ingenuity, Cassini, Bennu).
5. **GO/NO-GO Poll:** Experience live space weather diagnostics (polls live NASA DONKI solar flare data; holds launch on X/M-class flares).
6. **Launch & Flight:** Execute SLS Block 1 staged launch sequence, manage deep space flight, and respond to dynamic space debris hazard pop-ups.
7. **Landing & Report:** Watch destination-specific Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL) and review the comprehensive scientific return debrief.

## The Problem

Designing interplanetary space missions requires rigorous trade-offs between vehicle mass, propellant fraction, electrical power, communication latency, and planetary hazard risks. Students and science enthusiasts rarely get to see how these interconnected decisions influence each other in real-time.

---

## Our Solution

**Mission Forge** places players in the role of Flight Directors and Aerospace Engineers. The application bridges open government space data and game design into a seamless 23-phase mission lifecycle:

$$\text{Briefing} \longrightarrow \text{Design \& Build} \longrightarrow \text{Trajectory Planning} \longrightarrow \text{Launch} \longrightarrow \text{Cruise \& Rescue} \longrightarrow \text{Landing \& Debrief}$$

The **Tsiolkovsky Rocket Equation** and the **Inverse-Square Law of Solar Radiation** mathematically dictate whether a spacecraft can reach its destination and operate its payloads.

## Key Features

- **9 Solar System Destinations:** Earth, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Europa, Titan, Ceres, Jupiter, and Saturn with authentic planetary gravities, scale heights, and surface environments.
- **Official NASA 3D Resources:** 11 flight-proven spacecraft 3D models (`.glb`) and 8 authentic planetary cylindrical surface maps (`.webp`/`.jpg`) sourced directly from NASA Centers (JPL-Caltech, GSFC, JSC, Langley).
- **Tsiolkovsky Rocket Equation Engine:** Live dynamic calculation of $\Delta v = I_{\text{sp}} \cdot g_0 \cdot \ln(m_{\text{wet}} / m_{\text{dry}})$ with authentic propulsion systems (Hydrolox RL10, Methalox Raptor, Xenon Ion NSTAR, Hall Thruster HERMeS).
- **Multi-Agency Open Data Platform:** Comprehensive catalog and discovery engine for NASA and all 17 Space Apps Challenge 2026 partner space agencies (ESA, JAXA, CSA, DLR, UKSA, ISRO, ASI, CNES, and more).
- **Flight Director GO/NO-GO Launch Poll:** Actively evaluates real-time space weather using NASA DONKI flare telemetry; holds launch if geomagnetic solar storms are detected.
- **Real-Time Astronomical Calculations:** Real distances and speed-of-light communications delay ($t_{\text{delay}} = d / c$) computed live via NASA JPL Horizons ephemerides.
- **3D Staged Launch & Flight:** SLS Block 1 staged ascent (SRB jettison, Core Stage MECO, orbital insertion), 6-DOF docking rendezvous, and atmospheric entry.
- **Failure & Recovery Architecture:** Non-lethal contingency diagnostics in the `rescue` phase teaching real aerospace problem-solving (e.g., Apollo 13 / SOHO recovery).
- **Interactive Science Data Center:** Deep exploration suite for APOD, NeoWs asteroids, DSCOVR EPIC, Mars Rover imagery, JPL SBDB, and Sentry impact risk.
